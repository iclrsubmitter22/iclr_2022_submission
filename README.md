# ICLR2022 submission
Here is the repository to reproduce the results of our iclr22 submission. It involves four major steps : pseudo-labels extraction, pretext tasks selection and weighting, self-supervised training, downstream finetuning. 


### Feature extraction
The extraction is done with the Opensmile library, all the files concerned are in the folder "data\_preparation/" and it involves three steps : 
- Extracting the signal features using the two scripts 
- Mixing the two sets of features
- Normalizing the values per feature


### Pretext task selection and weighting 



### Self-supervised training



### Downstream finetuning
